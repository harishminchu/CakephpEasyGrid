CakephpEasyGrid
===============
This is a simple to use Cakephp scaffolding addition to allow for easily adding Extjs Grids to your Cakephp applications without any knowledge of Extjs.  This application addes the /grid scaffold to your applications so you can quickly get an editable grid for each of your Cakephp models.


Cakehp Files
=========

EasyGridScaffold.php

This is an subclass of the controller Scaffold class.  It contains methods to handle CRUD requests from the Extjs Grid.  The grid is generated by the 'grid' request


AppModel.php

This contains all the funtions that each model must have in order to be able to send model infromation to the Extjs front end.  This will be replaced with a cakephp behavior so that AppModel.php doesn't have to be modified

grid.ctp

This is the view used by the EasyGridSaccfold class.  Add this to your app/View/Scaffolds/ folder

Javascript Files
===============
